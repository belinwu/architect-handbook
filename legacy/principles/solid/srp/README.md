## Definition

Software systems are changed to satisfy users and stakeholders, those are the "reason to change". We'll refer to those groups as an actor. SRP states:

> A module should be _responsible_ to one, and only one, actor.

The simplest definition of _module_ is just a source file, which means a "cohesive" set of functions and data structures. _Cohesion_ is the force that binds together the code responsible to a single a actor.

> The word "cohesive" implies the SRP.

The _Single Responsibility Principle_ is about __functions and classes__, but it reappears in a different form at two more levels:

* Component level: __Common Closure Principle__.
* Architectural level: __Axis of Change__ (responsible for the creation of Architectural Boundaries).

## Usual Mistake

This principle is __usually mistaken with another principle__ that is not one of the SOLID principles:

> A function should do one, and only one thing.

## Symptoms of violating SRP

* Accidental Duplication
* Merges
* Others

### Accidental Duplication

![accidental duplication](./srp-violation-1.png)

This `Employee` class violates the SRP because those three methods are responsible to three very different actors.

* `calculatePay()` method is specified by the accounting department, which reports to the CFO
* `reportHours()` method is specified and used by the human resources department, which reports to the COO.
* `save()` method is specified by the database administrators (DBAs), who report to the CTO.

By putting the source code for these three methods into a single `Employee` class, the developers have coupled each of these actors to the others. This coupling can cause the actions of the CFO's team to affect something that the COO's team depends on.

For example, suppose that the `calculatePay()` function and the `reportHours()` function share a common algorithm for calculating non-overtime hours. Suppose also that the developers, who are careful not to duplicate code, put that algorithm into a function named `regularHours()`.

Now suppose that the CFO's team decides that the way non-overtime hours are calculated needs to be tweaked. In contrast, the COO's team in HR does not want that particular tweak because they use non-overtime hours for a different purpose.

A developer is tasked to make the change, and sees the convenient `regularHours()` function called by the `calculatePay()` method. Unfortunately, the developer does not notice that the function is also called by the `reportHours()` function.

Required change is tested. CFO's team validates the new function and system is deployed. Of course, COO's team doesn't know that this is happening. Eventually problem is discovered, and bad data has cost COO's budget millions of dollars.

These problem occur because we put code that different actors depend on into close proximity. The SRP says to __separate the code that different actors depend on__.

### Merges

It's not hard to imagine that merges will be common in source files that contain many different methods. This situation is especially likely if those methods are responsible to different actors.

For example, suppose that the CTO's team of DBAs decide that there should be a simple schema change to the `Employee` table of the database. Suppose also that COO's team of HR clerks decide that they need a change in the format of the hours report.

Two different developers, possible from two different teams, check out the `Employee` class and begin to make changes. Unfortunately their changes collide and result in a merge.

The merge puts both the CTO and COO at risk.

### Other Symptoms

There are many other symptoms that we could investigate, but they all involve multiple people changing the same source file for different reasons.

Once again, the way to avoid this problem is to __separate the code that supports different actors__.

## SRP Implementation Ideas

There are many solutions, __each moves functions into different classes__. Perhaps the most obvious way to solve the problem is to __separate the data from the functions__.

In our example, the three classes share access to `EmployeeData`, which is a simple data structure with no methods. Each class holds only the source code necessary for its particular function. The three classes are not allowed to know about each other. Thus accidental duplication is avoided.

The downside of this solution is that developers now have three classes that they have to instantiate and track. A common solution to this dilemma is to use the __Facade__ pattern.

![srp-solution-2](./srp-solution-2.png)

The `EmployeeFacade` contains very little code. It is responsible for instantiating and delegating to the classes with the functions.

Some developers prefer to __keep the most important business rules closer to the data__. This can be done by keeping the most important method in the original `Employee` class and then using that class as a _Facade_ for lesser functions.

![srp-solution-3](./srp-solution-3.png)

The number of functions required to calculate pay, generate a report, or save the data is likely to be large in each case. Each of those classes would have many _private_ methods in them. Each of the classes that contain such a family of methods is a __scope__. Outside of that scope, no one knows that the private members of that family exist.

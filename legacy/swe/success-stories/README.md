### "Test Mercenaries" & "Testing on the Toilet"

A program called *Test Mercenaries* was intended to roll out test automation practices at Google many years ago. The reason that program even got started was because of previous endeavors by what we would now call a comunity of practice (i.e. *Grouplet* in Google nomenclature) to sahre the importance of automated testing.

One of the program's early effort in sharing information about testing was an iniative calld *"Testing on the Toilet"*. It consisted of brief, one-page articles pinned to the back on the toilet doors so folks could read them "at their leisure".

As part of this program, Google ended up creating frameworks to make test suite creation and management easier, promoted visibility of tests as part of the code review system, and even ended up driving the creation of a new company-wide CI tool to make test execution easier.

# Blameless Post-Mortem Culture

The key to learning from your mistakes is to document your failures by performing aroot-cause analysis and writing up a “*postmortem*”.

A properpostmortem  should  always  contain  an  explanation  of  what  was  learned  and  what  isgoing to change as a result of the learning experience. Then, make sure that the post‐mortem is readily accessible and that the team really follows through on the proposedchanges.

* A brief summary of the event
* A timeline of the event, from discovery through investigation to resolution
* The primary cause of the event
* Impact and damage assessment
* A set of action items (with owners) to fix the problem immediately
* A set of action items to prevent the event from happening again
* Lessons learned

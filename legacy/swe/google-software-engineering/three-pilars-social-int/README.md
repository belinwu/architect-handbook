# Three Pilars of Social Interaction

1. **Humility**: You are not the center of the universe (nor is your code!). You’re neither omnis‐cient nor infallible. You’re open to self-improvement.

2. **Respect**: You genuinely care about others your work with.  You treat them kindly andappreciate their abilities and accomplishments.

3. **Trust**: You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and you’re OK withletting them drive when appropriate.

If you perform a root-cause analysis on almost any social conflict, you can ultimatelytrace it back to a lack of humility, respect, and/or trust.

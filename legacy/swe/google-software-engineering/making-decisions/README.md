# Making Decisions

Being data driven is a good start, but in reality, most decisions are based on a mix of data, assumption, precedent, and argument. Itâ€™s best when objective data makes up the majority of those inputs, but it can rarely be *all* of them.

Being data driven over time implies **the need to change directions when the data changes** (or when assumptions are dispelled). **Mistakes or revised plans are inevitable**.

## Overview

Reading data from a database is all very well, but in order to write data back you need to tie the database to the in-memory object system.

## How It Works

### Choosing Your Key

#### Meaningful - Meaningless

A **meaningful key** is something like the U.S. Social Security number for identifying a person.

A **meaningless key** is essentially a random number the database dreams up that's never intended for human use.

#### Simple - Compound

A **simple key** uses only one database field; a **compound key** uses more than once.

* *Compound keys* are often easier to use when one table makes sense in the context of another.
* If you use *simple keys* everywhere, you can use the same code for all key manipulation.
* *Compund keys* require sepcial handling in concrete classes (with code generation this isn't a problem).
* *Compund keys* carry a bit of meaning, so be careful about the uniqueness and immutability.
* Mostly, you want a type with a fast equality operation and get next key operation

#### Table-unique - Database-unique

A **table-unique key** is unique across the table, which is what you need for a key in any case; a **database-unique key** is unique across every row in every table in the database.

* *Database-unique key* is often easier to do and allows you to use a single *Identity Map*
  * It's pretty unlikely that you'll run out of numbers for new keys.
  * You can reclaim keys from deleted objects.
* *Database-unique key* is easier to handle inheritance. If you're using *Concrete Table Inheritance* or *Class Table Inheritance*, life is much easier with keys that are unique to the hierarchy rather than unique to each table.

### Representing the *Identity Field* in an Object

* The simplest form is a field that matches the type of the key in the database.
* For compound key, make a generic key class that can store a sequence of objects that act as the elements of the key.
  * The key behavior for the key object is equality.
* *Layer Supertype*
  * If you are using the same basic structure for all keys, you can do all of the key handling in it.
  * Use it for default behavior and extend for exceptional cases in the particular subtypes.

### Getting a New Key

* Get the database to auto-generate
  * Alternative, is a **database counter** (select statement that references to a sequence)
* Use a GUID
* Generate your own
  * Simple scan using SQL max function to find largest key (read-locks entire table).
  * Separate *key table*, usually two columns: name, next available value.
    * If you use *database-unique keys*, you'll have just one row in this table.
    * If you use *table-unique keys*, you'll have one row for each table in the database.
    * It's usually a good idea to put access to the key table in a separate transaction, so you only lock the row for a short transaction, if you rollback on your business transaction, you'll lose the key but, fortunately, numbers are "cheap".

## When to Use It

* Use *Identity Field* when there's a mapping between objects in memory and rows in a database. This is usually when you use *Domain Model* or *Row Data Gateway*.

* *Identity Map* is an alternative to maintain the correspondence in systems where you don't want to store an *Identity Field* in the in-memory object. In this case, *Identity Map* would need to look up both ways: give me a key for an object or an object for a key. It's usually easier to store the key in the object.

* You don't need this mapping if you're using *Transaction Script*, *Table Module*, or *Tabla Data Gateway*.

* For a small object with value semantics, such as a money or date range object that won't have its own table, it's better to use *Embedded Value*.

* For a complex graph of objects that doesn't need to be queried with the relational database, *Serialized LOB* is usually easier to write and gives faster performacne.

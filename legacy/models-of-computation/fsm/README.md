# Finite State Machine

## Definition

A __finiste-state machine__ (FSM), or __finiste-state automation__ (FSA, plural: automata), __finite automaton__, or simply a __state machine__, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.

The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs, the change from one state to another is called a __transition__. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition.

Finite-state machines are of two types: _Deterministic FSM_ and _Non-deterministic FSM_.

FSM has less computational power than some other models of computation such as the _Turing Machine_. The computational power distinction means there are computational tasks that a Turing machine can do but an FSM cannot. This is because an FSM's memory is limited by the number of states it has. A finite-state machine has the same computational power as a Turing machine that is restricted such that its head may only perform "read" operations, and always has to move from left to right.

FSMs are studied in more generald field of __Automata Theory__.

## Examples

The behavior of state machines can be observed in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented. Simple examples are __vending machines__, which dispense products when the proper combination of coins is deposited, __elevators__, whose sequence of stops is determined by the floors requested by riders, __traffic lights__, which change sequence when cars are waiting, and __combination locks__, which require the input of a sequence of numbers in the proper order.

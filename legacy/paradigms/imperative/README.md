# Imperative Programming

Programming paradigm that uses __statements that change a program's state__. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.

> Imperative pgoramming focuses on describing _how_ a program operates.

The term is often used in contrast to _declarative programming_, which focuses on _what_ the program should accomplish withput specifying how the program should achieve the result.

## Procedural Programing

Procedural programming is a __type of imperative programming__ in which the program is built from one or more procedures, also termed subroutines or functions.

The terms are often used as synonyms, but the use of procedures has a dramatic effect on how imperative programs appear and how they are constructed. State changes are localized to procedures or restricted to explicit arguments and returns from procedures, in a form of Structured Programming.

Procedural programming could be considered a step toward declarative programming. A programmer can often tell by simply looking at the names, arguements, and return types of procedures (and related comments), what a particular procedure is supposed to do, without necessarily looking at the details of how it achieves its result.

At the same time, a complete program is still imperative since it _fixes_ the statements to be executed and their order of execution to a large extent.

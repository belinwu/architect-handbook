# Traits

Traits also gives another alternative for _Multiple Inheritance_.

Traits are used to __declare methods that can be used in multiple classes__. Traits can have methods and abstract methods that can be used in multiple classes.

A Trait is similar to a class, but only intended to group functionality in a fine-grained and consistent way. It is not possible to instantiate a Trait on its own. It is an additional to traditional inheritance and enables horizontal composition of behavior, that is, the application of class members without requiring inheritance.

## Traits vs Mixins

The main difference is that Mixins can have state while traits don't.

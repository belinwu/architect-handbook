# Abstract Class

A Class which main purpose is to __define common interface for its subclasses__.

An Abstract Class will defer some or all of its implementations to operations defined in subclasses, hence an Abstract Class cannot be instantiated.

The operations that an abstract class declares but doesn't implement are called abstract operations.

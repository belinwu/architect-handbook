# Subtyping - Interface Inheritance

Class inheritance defines an object's implementation in terms of another object's implementation, working as a mechanism for code and representation sharing.

Interface inheritance or _Subtyping_ __describes when an object can be used in place of another__, working as a mechanism for interface sharing without restricting to a particular implementation.

# Functional Programming

> Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment.

Functional programming was the first paradigm to be invented, but has only recenlty begun to be adopted. Indeed, its invention predates computer programming itself.

It is the direct result of the work of _Alonzo Church_, who in _1936_ invented _Pi-Calculus_ while pursuing the same mathematical problem that was motiving _Alan Turing_ at the same time. His _Pi-Calculus_ was the foundation of the LISP language, invented in _1958_ by _John McCarthy_.

A foundational notion of _Pi-Calculus_ is __immutability__, that is, the notion that the values of symbols do not change. This effectively means that __a functional language has no assignment statement__ (most functional languages do, in fact, have some means to alter the value of a variable, but only under very strict discipline).

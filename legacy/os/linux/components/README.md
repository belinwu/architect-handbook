## Bootloader

Code that runs to guide the booting process to start the operating system.

> Parrot Linux uses the GRUB Bootloader.

## OS Kernel

The kernel virtualizes and manages the the hardware resources  like CPU, memory, and I/O devices. It gives each process its own virtual resources and prevents/mitigates conflicts between different processes.

## Daemons

Background services are called "daemons" in Linux. They are programs that load after booted/login and support key functions such as scheduling, printing, and multimedia.

## Shell

The command line is the interface between the OS and the user.

> Some commonly used are Bash, Tsch/Csh, Ksh, Zsh, and Fish.

## Graphics server

Provides a graphical sub-system (server) called "X" or "X-Server" that allows graphical programs to run locally or remotely on the X-windowing system.

## Window Manager

Also known as a _graphical user interface_ (GUI). A desktop environment usually has several applications (e.g., file and web browsers) that allow the user to access and manage the essential features of an OS.

## Utilities

Applications that perform particular functions for the user or another program. Also, _system utilities_ make available OS functionality to the user.

# Batch Processing

Batch processing is the **processing of transactions in a group** or batch.

> No user interaction is required once batch processing is underway. This differentiates batch processing from transaction processing, which involves processing transactions one at a time and requires user interaction.

Batch processing jobs are usually run on *regularly scheduled times* but can be run on an as-needed basis at any time, it is particularly suited at *end-of-cycle processing* (e.g, processing bank's reports at the end of a day or generating monthly payrolls).

> One caveat is that the inputs for the processing must be correct or else the results of the whole batch will be faulty, which would cost time and money.

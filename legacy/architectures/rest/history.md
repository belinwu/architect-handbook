# REST History

Roy Fielding defined REST in his 2000 PhD dissertation "_Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures_". He developed the REST architectural style in parallel with HTTP 1.1 of 1996-1999, based on the existing design of HTTP 1.0 of 1996, and was used in designing the _Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)_ standard.

> Roy Fielding: "Throughout the standarization process, I was called on to defend the design choices of the Web. That is an extremly difficult thing to do within a process that accepts proposals from anyone on a topic that was rapidly becoming the center of an entire industry. I had comments from well over 500 developers, many of whom where distinguished engineers with decades of experience, and I had to explain everything from the most abstract notions of Web interaction to the finest details of HTTP syntax. That process honed my model down to a core set of principles, properties, and constraints that are now called REST.

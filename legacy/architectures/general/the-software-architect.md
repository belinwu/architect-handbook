## Architect's value

Architects play a critical role as a __connecting and translating element__, especially in large organizations where departments speak different languages, have different viewpoints, and drive toward conflicting objectives.

> The worst-case scenario materializes when people holding relevant information or expertise aren't empowered to make decisions, whereas the decision makers lack relevant information.

Some of the valuable things an architect does are:

- Connect the dots, interdependencies are well understood.
- See trade-offs.
- Look beyond products.
- Articulate strategy to suport the business strategy.
- Fight complexity.
- Deliver.

> Staying grounded in reality and receiving feedback on decisions from real project implementations is vital for architects. Orherwise, _control remains an illusion_.

## The Architect Elevator

Architects work closely with technical staff on projects, but are also able to convey technical topics to upper management _without losing the essence of the message_. Conversely, they understand the company's business strategy and can translate it into technical decisions that support it.

The value of the architects in the elvator metaphor shouldn't be measured by how "high" they travel but by _how many floors they span_.

> Allowing architects to only enjoy the view from high up invariable leads to the dreaded _authority without responsibility antipattern_. This pattern can be broken only if architects have to live with, or at least observe, the consequences of their decisions. To do so, they must keep riding the elevator.

### Dangers of riding the elevator

#### Lift boys

Lift boys are folks who ride the elevator down merely to pick up buzzwords to sell as their own ideas in the penthouse. They ride the elevator but don't get out. They benefit from the ignorance in the penthouse to pursue a "technical" career without touching actual technology.

#### Systems resist change

Being __a disrputor__ is not easy. Both the penthouse and the engine room might actually have grown quite content with being disconnected: the company leadership is under the false impression that the digital transformation is proceeding nicely, whereas the folks in the engine room enjoy the freedom to try out new technnologies without much supervision. Such a disconnect between the two resembles a cruise ship heading for an iceberg with the engines running at full speed ahead.

> I was once critized by the engine room for pushing corporate agenda against the will of the developers while at the same time corporate leadership chastised me for wanting to try new solutions just for fun. Ironically, this likely meant I found a good balance. - Gregor Hohpe

## What architects are not

> Exaggerated expectations can paint a picture of someone who solves intermittent performance problems in the morning and then transforms the enterprise culture in the afternoon.

Architects are pulled into several roles that clearly miss the puspose of being an architect:

### Senior Developer

Becoming an architect and a _superstar engineer_ are two different career paths. Architects tend to have a broader scope, including organizational and strategic aspects, whereas engineers tend to specialize and deliver running software.

### Firefighter

Architects are expected to be able to troubleshoot and solve any crisis based on their broad understanding of the current system landscape.

Needless to say, architects shouldn't ignore production issues, because they provide valuable feedback into possible architectural weaknesses. But running from one fire drill to the next won't allow time to think about architecture. __Architecture isn't operations__.

### Project manager

Architect's decisions take into account -and affect- project time lines, staffing, and required skill sets. As a result, upper management often comes to rely on architects for project information. It's valuable work, but it distracts from the architect's main responsibility.

### Scientist

Architects need to sport a sharp intellect and must be able to think in _models and systems_, but the decisions they make impact real business projects. __Architects produce more than paper__.

Lastly, although scientists may get their papers published by making things sound complex and difficult to understand, an architect's job is the inverse: __making complex topics easy to digest__.

## Architects deal with non-requirements

Architects deal with __requirements that aren't stated anywhere__. This includes context, tacit assumptions, hidden dependencies, and other things that were never spelled out. Unearthing these implicit requirements and __making them explicit__ is one of an architect's most valuable contributions.

> It is a common misconception that developers deal with functional requirements, whereas architects deal with nonfunctional requirements (i.e., scalability, maintainability, availability, interoperability, and so on.).

## Prototypical Architects

In the end, most architects exhibit a combination of these prototypical stereotypes. Periodic gluing, gardening, guiding, impressing, and a little bit of all knowing every now and then can make for a pretty good architect.

### The Matrix: The Master Planner

All-knowingness turns out to be too ambitious for humans. Leading to poor decision-making and all sorts of other porblems. Even if the architect is a super-smart person, they can base decisions on only those facts that are known to them. In large companies with a complex IT, it would be impossible to stay in touch with all technology that is in place.

They'll therefore inevitably need to rely on presentations, documents, or statements from management on the middle floors. Such an information channel to the supreme decision maker has severe challenges: every floor through which such a document passes understands its value as an influencing vehicle, meaning they will be tempted to inject their favorite messages and project proposals. Further up, any real technical content or potentially controversial topics are sure to be removed.

As a result, __the top architect is being fed indirect, distorted, and often biased information__. Making decisions based on such information is dangerous.

### Edward Scissorhands: The Gardener

The role of the gardener is to __trime and prune what doesn't fit and to establish an overall balance and harmony in the garden, keeping in mind the plants' needs__.

A good gardener, just like a good architect, is __no dictatorial master planner__ and certainly doesn't make all the detailed decisions about which direction a strain of grass should grow. Rather, gardeners see themselves as the __caretaker of a living ecosystem__.

### Vanishing Point: The Guide

An architect as __a tour guide__, someone who has been to a certain place many times, can tell a good story about it, and can gently guide you to pay attention to important aspects and avoid unnecessary risks. This is __a guiding role__.

This type of architect needs to __"lead by influence"__ and must be hands-on enough to earn the respect of those whom they're leading. The tour guide also __stays along for the ride__ and doesn't just hand a map to the tourist.

### The Wizard of Os

Architects can sometimes be seen as wizards who can solve just about any technical challenge. Although that can be a short-term ego boost, it's not a good job description and expectation to live up to.

### Superhero vs super-glue

Amir Shenhav from Intel appropriately pointed out that instead of the superhero we need _"super-glue"_ architects: the guys who hold architecture, technical details, business needs, and people together across a large organization or complex projects. An architect being __a catalyst__.

Being __the glue__ means understanding a good bit about the things you glue together.

## Quotes

> If an IT system can still absorb high rates of change after many years, the project team probably included a good architect.

### Simon Brown

It's about designing software and solving problems within a specific organizational context, and being aware of what's happening around you, so that you can successfully navigate and influence that context where necessary.

> Architects need to communicate and influence at different levels, with different audiences, both inside and outside of their immediate team environment.

Avoid the "business versus IT" mindset. Learn how to see the bigger picture to map and influence the organizational landscape, how to deal with vendors, and how to communicate across all levels of an organization.

### David Knott

> Riding the architecture elevator is how my team and I spend our time.

Racing from one part of our organization to another, connecting, explaining questioning, and trying to make good decisions about complex systems with imperfect information. The elevator takes us from code to business strategy and back again, all within the same day.

> If you're not taking meaningful decisions, making them explicit, and helping people understand them, you're not doing architecture.

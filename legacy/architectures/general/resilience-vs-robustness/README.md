# Resilience vs Robustness

We talk about *resilience* when we want to improve a system's ability to avoid outages, handle failures gracefully when they occur, and recover quickly when problems happen.

*Robustness* is the ability to have a system that is able to react to expected variations, while *resilience* is having a system capable of adapting to things that haven't been though of.

> Resilience could include creating a culture of experimentation through things like *chaos engineering*.

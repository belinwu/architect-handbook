DDD is a set of principles and schemas aimed at creating optimal systems of objects. The development process boild down to creating abstractions called *domain models*. These models include business logic that links the actual conditions of a product's application to code.

The DDD approach is especially useful when the developer is not an expert in the product being developed. Through a domain-specific approach, a developer can easily design an application based on key-points and knowledge of the work area.

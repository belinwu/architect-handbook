# Planning a Migration

## The Goal

> "**Microservices are not the goal**. You don't win by having microservices". - Sam Newman

You should be thinking of migrating to a microservice architecture in order to achieve something that you can't currently achieve with your existing system architecture.

### Three Key Questions

* **What are you hoping to achieve?**: Set of outcomes that are aligned to what the business is trying to achieve, and can be articulated in a way that describes the benefit to the end users of the system.

* **Have you considered alternatives to using microservices?**: Qite often you can get what you need by using a much easier, more boring technique.

* **How will you know if the transition is working?**

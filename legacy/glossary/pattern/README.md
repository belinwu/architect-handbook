# Pattern

There's no generally accepted definition of a pattern.

> *"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."* - Christopher Alexander, architect.

Once you need the pattern, you have to figure out how to apply it to your circumstances. A key thing about patterns is that you can never just apply the solution blindly.

> *"I like to say that patterns are "half baked," meaning that you always have to finish them off in the oven of your own project."* - Martin Fowler

Patterns aren't original ideas; they're very much observations of what happens in the field. As a result, patterns get "discovered" rather than "invented".

For an experienced designer, the value of the pattern is not that it gives you a new idea; **the value lies in helping you communicate your idea**. The result is that patterns **create a vocabulary** about design.

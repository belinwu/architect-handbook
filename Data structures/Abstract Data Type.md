# Abstract data type
## Definition
ADT is a **mathematical model** for data types, analogous to an algebraic structure. It consists of a domain, a collection of operations, and a set of constraints the operations must satisfy.
ADTs are a **theoretical concept**, used in formal semantics and program verification and, less strictly, design and analysis of algorithms.
## ADT vs data structures
ADT, as a mathematical model, contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not an user.
For example, a stack has push/pop operations that follow a LIFO rule, and can be concretely implemented using either a list or an array.

# Universal hashing
## Definition
Universal hashing refers to selecting a hash function at random from a family of hash functions with a certain mathematical property. This guarantees a low number of collisions in expectation.
Many universal families are known (for hashing integers, vectors, strings), and their evaluation is often very efficient.

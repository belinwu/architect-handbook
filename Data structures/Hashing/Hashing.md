# Hashing
## Definition
Use of hash function to index a [[Hash map]] is called *hashing* or *scatter-storage addressing*.
Hashing is a computationally- and storage-space-efficient form of data access that **avoids the non-constant access time** of ordered and unordered lists and structured trees, and the often-exponential storage requirements of direct access of state spaces of large or variable-length keys.
